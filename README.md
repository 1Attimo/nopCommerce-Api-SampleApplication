# nopCommerce-Api-Authorization

In this sample project we have demonstrated how clients can authorize and obtain Access/Refresh tokens that can be used to access the nopCommerce Web API, which is available as a plugin and provides a RESTful API to various resources in nopCommerce i.e Customers, Categories, Products, Shopping Cart Items, Orders. The nopCommerce Web API plugin is available for nopCommerce 3.70 and could be found in this repo - https://github.com/SevenSpikes/nopCommerce/tree/Web-Api-3.70

nopCommerce Web API plugin support OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code grant type. This grant type is suitable for server applications that want to have access to the Web API resources.

The standard Authorization Code Grant flow is described in Section 4.1 of the The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework - http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749
